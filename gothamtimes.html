            <h2>Riddler Terrorizes Gotham!</h2>

            <div class="author">By Alice.On.Acid</div>
            <p>A harrowing scene last night as a city couple was kidnapped and left, duct-taped to a light pole with a purple question mark
                spray painted across them both. City officials say it is yet again, the work of city terrorist -- The Riddler. Details are hazy 
                but from what we've gathered, the masked assailant is known for his purple domino mask and green question mark-covered costume, 
                a business suit. </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                Witnesses at the scene, claim riddler was seen running across the rooftops of 5th and Madison
            </blockquote>
            <p>The perp dons a bowler hat and his special question mark shaped cane-a rather eccentric choice of fashion.
                Seeking answers, I spoke with Psychology Intern Dr. Harleen Quinzel who gave me insight regarding
                riddlers psyche. 
                "He's motivated to be evil because he thinks that its a "beautiful" idea that proves his intellectual superiority. 
                He's also fueled by the mistakes he's made and embraces the darker side of himself to avoid confronting his crimes." 
                During our discussion Dr. Quinzel, who insisted I call her harley Quinn, was able to describe what or rather who the villain may target next.
                "Apparently Riddler is obsessed with riddles, puzzles, 
                and word games which explains the bizarre scenario of last night. He's becoming increasingly erratic but the patterns I've noticed is his victims are all 
                either affluent or a part of high society". </p>

                <p>One can only hope the brave fantastic officers of Gotham PD get to him before another crime is committed. 
                Commissioner Gordon is expected to give a debrief later this evening. Please stay safe folks</p>

                <h2>Billionaire Bruce Wayne Returns To Gotham</h2>
            <img src="bruce.png.jpg" height="700" width="480" alt="bruce wayne">
            <p>Following an expedition to the country of Sierra Leone, 
                Elusive Billionaire, Bruce Wayne, has returned to gotham where he will host
                his annual Carbanado Ball with wife Selena Kyle-Wayne, where their coveted art collection will be auctioned off to the highest bidders, and all proceeds will go towards the liberation of Child Mine workers
                in sierra leone and their families. Wayne has been working tirelessly to shut down the mining companies
                found throughout the region due to their abusive tactics, sadistic approach and horrendous conditions along with 
                numerous human rights violations against the women and children in the area. <br>
                As most know, Bruce Wayne is the son of famed Surgeon Thomas Wayne who was tragically
                gunned down,along with Martha Arkham-Wayne, 18 years ago in front of young bruce. Many have 
                speculated as to whether crime boss Carmine Falcone was responsible for the hit that 
                criminal "Joe Chill" carried out but there has never been an evidence of this.

                <h2> Priceless Diamond Grifted</h2>
                Late last night, the hope diamond gifted to Socialite Evalyn Walsh,
                was swiped from the Smithsonian Museum of History. 3 Security Guards
                were subdued by a masked thief described as a woman with feline manuevers, dressed in a skintight
                utility suit. The Hope Diamond was a present from Evalyn's husband Edward Beale McClean in 1912. McClean is sadisticto have paid $300,000
                for the 45.52 carat gray-blue stone piece. However, the stone was (and for some believers still is) rumored to be cursed with its past owners having committed suicide,
                been violently murdered or died in abject poverty. Despite her own string of personal tragedies including the accidental death of her son and the bankruptcy of her familyâ€™s newspaper The Washington Post, Walsh herself did not believe the Hope Diamond was cursed.
